My Capstone idea was to create a hair stylist hub. In this hub, I will attempt to implement the following:

1. Appointment information, this includes daily charts on the home screen, showing the appointments scheduled for the day
and the ability to select the appointments to start, edit and delete them.

2. Client information storage, this will be a short profile for the client. All information about past appointments will be searchable
and photos can be submitted with each appointment, showing the stylist and the client exactly what service they had on what date.
The option to delete and edit client information will also be present.

3. Inventory management, this will be an area that contains all products either available for purchase, or available for use within the salon. all numbers will have to be manually input at first and then from there will have a + and - button to help with the management. 
The option to delete and edit items will also be present.

4. User time management, the user will be able to clock in and clock out
